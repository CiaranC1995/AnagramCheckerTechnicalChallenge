# Anagram Checker Technical Challenge
My implementation of the Anagram Checker technical challenge.

Thanks for taking the time to use my Anagram Checker program. It is comprised of a Result class and the main AnagramCheckerApplication class which contains the main 
method and is the starting point for the application. Also included in this class are utility methods that allow the program to function.

I believe I have successfully implemented all of the main requirements and I have also included a few of the 'nice-to-have' elements which are listed below:

- Entries in the file and cache should be unique
- Validate that the inputs do not have special characters 
- Upon start-up, populate the cache with the previous results stored in the file

I have fully tested the Result.java class and included the JUnit Test Case for this with the source code. 

Also in included in the folder is the Javadoc generated from Eclipse for reference.

<h1>In order to use the program simply follow the onscreen instructions. They will guide you step by step.</h1>

I hope you enjoy using this simple program, hope to hear from you soon.
